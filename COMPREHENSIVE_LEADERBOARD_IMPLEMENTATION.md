# COMPREHENSIVE LEADERBOARD SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## üéØ Overview
Successfully implemented a fully functional leaderboard system with database integration and point calculation algorithms as requested: "make fully functional ledrebord with dtabase and point calulation algoritham(which is not seen by user) also pop up some prizes tosts and notifications no more mock datas fetch all user data from databse and compare them and use ledrbordscaling algo to rank them and give them prizes"

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Tables Created
1. **user_rankings** - Core leaderboard data with points, streaks, and achievement levels
2. **prizes** - Prize catalog with rarity, requirements, and metadata
3. **user_prizes** - Claimed prizes tracking
4. **leaderboard_snapshots** - Historical leaderboard data for analytics

### Advanced Database Functions
- `calculate_scan_points()` - Sophisticated point calculation algorithm
- `update_user_ranking()` - Automated ranking updates with streak calculation
- `recalculate_leaderboard_ranks()` - Global ranking recalculation
- `get_eligible_prizes()` - Prize eligibility checker
- `claim_prize()` - Prize claiming mechanism

## üß† Point Calculation Algorithm
Sophisticated multi-factor scoring system:

```typescript
const calculatePointsForScan = (scanData) => {
  // Base points from eco score (0-100)
  let basePoints = scanData.ecoScore || 50;
  
  // Scan type bonuses
  const scanTypeBonus = {
    'camera': 1.2,      // 20% bonus for camera scans
    'upload': 1.0,      // Standard points for uploads  
    'text_search': 0.8  // 80% points for text search
  };
  
  // Alternative products bonus (encourages finding eco-friendly options)
  const alternativeBonus = scanData.alternatives ? 
    Math.min(scanData.alternatives.length * 5, 25) : 0;
  
  // Streak multiplier (rewards consistency)
  const streakMultiplier = scanData.currentStreak > 7 ? 1.5 : 
                          scanData.currentStreak > 3 ? 1.2 : 1.0;
  
  // Final calculation
  const totalPoints = Math.round(
    (basePoints + alternativeBonus) * 
    scanTypeBonus[scanData.scanType] * 
    streakMultiplier
  );
  
  return Math.max(totalPoints, 10); // Minimum 10 points guaranteed
};
```
